# Homework5
For this homework assignment, we were to make a basic daily planner. I was able to get it to where the text input saves even when you refresh the page. But couldn't quite figure out how to get the past, present, future classes to work to change the color of the time blocks. Gonna keep working on it and try to figure it out.
